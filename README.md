Minimal addon for restacking Immature Venom Sacs in order to bump all stacks the the highest timer.

## Usage

Type ´/restack´ (or ´/rs´) to make the addon window appear. 

- **Count** will count the number of stacks in your inventory and check minimum and maximum timers.
- **Restack** will restack your sacs to make sure all of them have the highest timer.
- **Minimize** will minimize the number of slots taken by the venom sacs in your inventory **without checking the timers** so make sure you have restacked before. 

### How does restacking work ?

The addon will use the stack of your inventory that has the highest remaining timer and will then proceed to split this stack into as many slots as needed before restacking other sacs on these slots. This process is repeated until all sacs have been restacked.
